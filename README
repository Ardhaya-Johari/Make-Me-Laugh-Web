# 😂 Make Me Laugh!

Welcome to **Make Me Laugh!**, the web app that knows you're only one bad pun away from a good day. Enter your name, click a button, and boom — a joke just for you. No promises it'll be funny, but hey, we tried!

## 🌟 Features

- 🎭 Personalized jokes – because "random" is so last year.
- 🎨 Stylish, fun UI with consistent theme across pages.
- 🎉 Lightweight, fast, and 100% sass-free* (*unless the joke is about it).
- 💬 Expandable to include categories or joke APIs.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: EJS (Embedded JavaScript Templates), HTML5, CSS3
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Styling**: CSS (custom styling to match the joke vibe)
- **APIs**: Jokes sourced from a public joke API

## 📦 Installation & Running Locally
